[Ladybug Web 3D Models]( ./index.html#index.md )
===

_Not just pretty things to look at: 3D model data and viewers you can use for building and testing your 3D apps_

## Content

### [Galleries]( http://ladybug-analysis-tools.github.io/3d-models/index.html#gallery/readme.md )

A first glimpse at the possibilities offered by the Ladybug Web 3D Models viewers

* Menus to help you select what you want to see
* Viewers to display content in 3D
* Menus and read me files created using Markdown


The Galleries folder contains a three galleries of files. 
There's also a link to a Galley in the OBJ files

### [JSON Files]( http://ladybug-analysis-tools.github.io/3d-models/json/index.html )

## Code

_The scripts you can use to create and support the content_

### Browser Code

#### &#128279; [Ladybug Web JSON Browser]( ./viewers/json/browser/index.html )

View Three.js JSON and JS files from this repository - and from a variety of other repositories on GitHub

#### &#128279; [Ladybug Web OBJ Browser]( ./viewers/obj/browser/index.html )

View OBJ and MTL files from this repository - and from a variety of other repositories on GitHub

#### Notes

Both the above viewers display nearly raw or 'uncurated' models.

* File listings are gathered in real-time from the given repo.
* Models use varying scales and units. We try to make the model fit the screen
* Models are positioned all over the place. We try to position the model in the center of the screen
* For Three.js, Z-axis is out the screen. For many apps, its the Y-axis coming at you - so a number of models are rotated incorrectly. We don't know how to correct for this

Both these apps just create the users experience. 
They invoke their respective 'core' counterparts to do the opening loading and display of the models.
The communication between the apps is via location.hash through the core being embedded in an iframe in the browser app


### Opener Code


#### &#128279; [Ladybug Web JSON Opener]( ./viewers/json/opener/index.html )

Open and prepare JSON files 

#### &#128279; [Ladybug Web OBJ Opener]( ./viewers/obj/opener/index.html )

Open and prepare OBJ and MTL files 

#### Notes

* The scripts provide a user interface for setting viewing parameters
* These scripts manage their respective cores via standard iframe protocols


### Core Code

#### &#128279; [Ladybug Web JSON Core]( ./viewers/json/core/index.html )

The basic core or engine to load and display Three.js JSON and JS files

#### &#128279; [Ladybug Web OBJ Core]( ./viewers/obj/core/index.html )

The basic core or engine to load and display OBJ and MTL filea

#### Notes

* These scripts have minimal user interface
* Their job is to examine the data and send it to the appropriate loader
* They are designed to work inside iframes
