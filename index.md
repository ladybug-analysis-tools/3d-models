===

## [Ladybug Web JSON Browser]( ./viewers/json/browser/index.html )

View JSON files from this repository - and from a variety of other repositories on GitHub

## [Ladybug Web OBJ Browser]( ./viewers/obj/browser/index.html )

View OBJ files from this repository - and from a variety of other repositories on GitHub

Both the above viewers display nearly raw or 'uncurated' models.

* File listings are gathered in real-time from the given repo.
* Models use varying scales and units. We try to make the model fit the screen
* Models are position all over the place. We try to position the model in the center of the screen
* For Three.js, Z-axis is out the screen. For many apps, its the Y-axis coming at you - so a number of models are rotated incorrectly. We don't know how to correct for this


Further releases of these viewers will have curated revisions where everything is stipulated.
## Concept

Ladybug Web is about helping you carry out a variety of analysis on your building projects.

In order to test and verify that our studies are valid and that you can submit projects for study, 
we need a good number of building models - a '[corpora]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus )' of 3D data.

There are many thousands of 3D models online already, but hardly any are accessible online. 
Sites such SketcUp, Clario, SketchFab all require you to download models to your local hard disk.

The mission of  this site is to make a large number of models available for our testing. 
And since they are online and FOSS, you can use them too - for whatever purpose seves your needs.

## Licensing

Currently the work herein is under the MIT license

But consideration should be given to a dual license - either MIT or GPL

And furthermore, the models here are content much more than code, therefore a Creative Commons license may be appropriate

## Issues

Probably a majority of the files that you can view here had issues the first time they were opened by one of the scripts.
Each of these issues has been used to improve the process.
The more models we can access, the more issues we will find and the better we will get
