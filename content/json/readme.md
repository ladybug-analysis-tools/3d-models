[JSON Files Read Me]( index.html )
===


The menu for this folder uses the GitHub API to obtain the names of all the folders under this folder.
If any folder contains a read me file then it is added to this menu.
This ability allows you to add files without having to edit menus - which is handy when there are large numbers of files moving in and out of folders.

There are also three JSON files - created using [flux.io]( http://flux.io ) 
- that are not compatible with Three.js JSON files, but are kept here as test cases to help in identifying files.
